Web SDK - Quick Start Guide

The following guide helps you integrate the HyperKYC Web SDK and launch your first workflow in minutes.

Step 1: Add SDK to Your Project
Add the following script to your HTML page:

HTML
<script src="https://hv-web-sdk-cdn.hyperverge.co/hyperverge-web-sdk@<actual_SDK_VERSION>/src/sdk.min.js"></script>


Pro-Tip
Replace <SDK_VERSION> with the latest version listed in the Web SDK Changelog.

Step 2: Initialize and Launch the SDK
Initialize the SDK and launch a verification workflow in your JavaScript code:

JavaScript
const hyperKycConfig = new HyperKycConfig(
  "<ACCESS_TOKEN>",        // Short-lived token from your backend
  "<WORKFLOW_ID>",         // Workflow ID from HyperVerge Dashboard
  "<TRANSACTION_ID>",      // Unique identifier for this application
  true                      // Optional: true to show landing page, default is false
);

// Register callback to handle SDK result when verification completes
const handler = (HyperKycResult) => {
  // Log result for debugging
  console.log(
    `status=${HyperKycResult.status} code=${HyperKycResult.code} message=${HyperKycResult.message}`
  );

  // Handle verification outcome
  switch (HyperKycResult.status) {
    case "auto_approved":
      // All checks passed - update UI, proceed
      break;
    case "auto_declined":
      // Verification failed - show rejection UI
      break;
    case "needs_review":
      // Ambiguous result - show pending review UI
      break;
    case "user_cancelled":
      // User exited flow - handle gracefully
      break;
    case "error":
      // Technical failure - show retry option
      break;
  }
};

// Launch the HyperVerge SDK with configuration
await HyperKYCModule.launch(hyperKycConfig, handler);



The following table describes each parameter in the configuration:

Parameter	Description	Source
accessToken	Short-lived token from your backend	Generate Access Tokens
workflowId	Workflow identifier	HyperVerge Dashboard
transactionId	Unique session identifier	Generated by your backend
That's it! You've launched your first HyperKYC workflow.

Step 3: Handle Results & Test the Flow
The callback in Step 2 returns one of these statuses:

Status	Description
auto_approved	User verified successfully
auto_declined	Application rejected automatically
needs_review	Flagged for manual review
user_cancelled	User exited before completion
error	SDK or network issue
For detailed response formats, error codes, and field descriptions, see the SDK Response documentation.

Test: Build & run your app, trigger the launcher, complete a sample journey, and check the log output to confirm integration.
